# Analysis of Performance of Marketing Campaign

### Background and Context
It is important to be able to analyze data and provide recommendations to guide business strategies. An example of a project that would be asked to take on would be to assess the results of a test and to determine whether the business should implement in other markets.

### Project Task
I have received a data set which represents a city's order volume over a period of time. During this time period, there was a marketing campaign that featured discounts at select restaurants. I have been asked to assess the performance of this campaign and to highlight key learnings that the business can use for future campaigns.

Questions:
1) Please provide a high level summary of the campaign results.
2) How did customer behaviour change as a result of this campaign, if at all?
3) Did the campaign have any negative effects that we should be aware of?
4) What other data points would you recommend we look at (in addition to the data in this file) in order to learn more about how the campaign performed?
5) Based on the available information, would you recommend that we launch a similar campaign in other markets?

### *Disclaimer:* 
The data set is fake/simulated data and the company is anonymous for privacy concerns.
